## Tom Gaunt

I lead the [‚ÄúData Mining Epidemiological Relationships‚Äù](http://www.biocompute.org.uk/) programme in the [MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/integrative-epidemiology/) at the University of Bristol. We are interested in understanding the mechanisms of disease, and approach this through the integration of diverse biomedical and epidemiological data and the development of software tools for analysis of these data. One of our key developments is [EpiGraphDB](http://epigraphdb.org/), a database and software platform that integrates epidemiological and biomedical data to support mechanism discovery and aid causal inference.

### Collaborations and opportunities

We are always interested in hearing from potential collaborators or from talented graduate or postgraduate researchers who wish to pursue a career in software engineering applied to bioinformatics, molecular epidemiology or data science.
